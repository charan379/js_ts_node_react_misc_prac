- We have table `employee` with following columns
  id | name | salary | priority |

We need to change the `priority` of employee to `high` who is having the third highest salaray

Basically we need to use the Subquery to get the id of the emp and then update.

Query :

```sql
UPDATE employee SET  priority = "high" WHERE id = (
    SELECT id 
    FROM
    employee 
    ORDER BY salary DESC 
    OFFSET 2 
    LIMIT 1
    )
```
